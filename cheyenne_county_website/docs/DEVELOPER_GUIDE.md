Welcome to the Cheyenne County website developer guide. This document aims to guide developers through the structure, technologies used, and processes involved in maintaining and enhancing the website.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tools: Visual Studio Code, Live Server
- Deployment: FTP

## Project Structure
The project follows a straightforward structure to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.

## Editing the Website
Edits are typically handled by the County Administrator using Visual Studio Code, Live Server for previewing changes, and finally pushing updates via FTP to the local server.

## Styling & JavaScript
1. **CSS**
    - Edit styles in `/css/file.css`. The `base.css` file contains foundational styling.
    - *Note:* All CSS files are minified. Use an online CSS unminifier if needed.

2. **JavaScript**
    - Implement functionality adjustments in `/js/file.js`.
    - *Note:* All JS files are minified. Use an online JS unminifier if needed.
